                <p>For most of my childhood, my family owned a restaurant. The restaurant allowed me to gain experience by helping as a cashier. Helping at the restaurant was very eye opening, because I also saw and experienced the ill-termpered, rude, and obnoxious customers.<br><br></p>

After joining, I joined the executive board as a director, then the assistant secretary, and then the co-secretary. As secretary during my freshman year, I worked with Nicole Ni, who taught me a lot about using Google Sheets and gave me advice about Vincennes Early College. I was the secretary during my freshman and sophomore year, and then I was a member my junior year.<br><br></p>

After having bad experiences with the Key Club advisors, the Spanish teachers that were in charge of SHH really helped me find my voice. The SHH advisors really valued student input and really cared about the members (by being considerate with their time and financial situations).  <br><br></p>
