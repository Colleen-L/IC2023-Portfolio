                <p>I started to seriously play tennis 7th grade when the coaches' enthusiasm rubbed off on me. In 7th grade, I played varsity second singles. Sadly, the following year, the girls' season was canceled due to COVID. However, I did volunteer as the boys' tennis team manager, so luckily, I was still able to gain tennis experience. In high school, I have played tennis as varisty singles my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In my sophomore year, 2021-2022, our team won the sectional title for the first time in about 10-20 years. I hope to play tennis my senior year, and I hope to play tennis recreationally in college.<br><br></p>

                <p>I first started when I was about 8 years ago. I started piano lessons at IUPUI, which I recently learned was in the IUPUI School of Informatics and Computing. After the arts program at IUPUI closed, my brother and I followed our teacher to Butler, because she used to be a student at Butler. Currently, I am still taking lessons from my piano teacher, Amy Chee, at Butler. <br><br></p>

                <p>I did not watch a lot of shows or movies growing up. Occasionally, I remember watching some Chinese cartoons about sheeps and wolves and pigs. My cousin, Rachel Zheng, was the person that first introduced me to shows because she liked to play shows while she was participating in her hobbies. Later on, Anna Kavanaugh, helped me to better appreciate movies when she recommended me to watch VICE. While I still don't often watch shows and movies, I do watch occasionally because I do appreciate the cinematography and themes behind the good ones.<br><br></p>

                <p>My interest in math most likely stems from my mom. Because my mom was too old to attend high school when she immigrated to the United States, she went to school for her GED when I was about 8 years old. During that time, my mom would also teach me a little bit of what she was learning when we were at the restuarant. She taught me the times table, gave me challenge questions, and taught me a snippets of algebra. I learned to really enjoy the challenge and the concept of trying to solve problems.<br><br></p>
