                <p>This is the first achievement that I remember getting. Becoming a math master in elementary school definitely made me realize my own competitiveness. Additionally, it helped me further my interest in math, as I would have to research and learn LCM and GCF by myself. <br><br></p>

                <p>This award came as a surprise when I was randomly told about it in 5th grade. I never expected to be awarded for the way that I acted or interacted with other. But, ultimately, the award just served as a reminder to always be a good, caring, and accepting person. <br><br></p>

                <p>I have never been great with test-taking. However, this achievement made me become more open to the possibilities of conquering and surpassing what I thought were barriers. As I look back, this event may be the reason why I try hard in everything I do. The award made me realize that I could achieve anything as long as I am meticulous, hard-working, and believing in myself. Therefore, personally, I place a heavier emphasis on hard work, than I do on talent.<br><br></p>

                <p>This award taught me to always take my chances. I used to be fascinated in art up until 4th grade when I started to feel like my art wasn't good enough. I took the chance when the opportunity was presented; I thought, planned, and tried extremely hard to make the card up to my standards; and, ultimately, I surprised myself because I won the contest.<br><br></p>

                <p>Partially, I achieved this award because of my efforts in school, in academics and in extracurricular activites. However, I would have never been able to achieve this award without the support from my parents and my grandparents. Before I could drive, my grandparents would need to constantly pick me up from after-school activities and for tennis. And, every year, my parents helped my fill out FinalForms to participate in tennis, bought my equipment, and paid for my tennis uniforms. <br><br></p>
